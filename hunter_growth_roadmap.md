# 🐾 Hunter X Growth Roadmap

## 🥇 Phase 1: Signal Boost Foundation
> Focus on discoverability, retweets, and algorithm triggers

   - Apply in opinion and explainer threads when relevant

## 🥈 Phase 2: Engage the Right People

   - Only reply if:
     - Tweet is <6 hours old
     - Has >50 likes
     - Is from a curated KOL list
   - Use snarky or clever angle, not bland engagement

6. **💬 Boost `reply_to_comments()` Frequency**
   - Run hourly instead of twice per day
   - Prioritize tweets with most likes or quote replies

   - Tag relevant accounts: `@coinbase`, `@a16z`, `@paradigm`, etc.
   - Increases visibility via their network

8. **🧵 Use Viral Hooks in Threads**
   - Start with proven lines:
     - “If you’re in crypto, read this 👇”
     - “This shocked me 👇”
     - “The bull case for $___ in 3 tweets”

9. **📆 Smart Post Scheduling by Category**
   - **Sunday:** Explainer + Weekly Top Tweet
